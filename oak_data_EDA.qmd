### Create a data set that has the heights across seasons to compare them

```{r}

# Filter the initial seedling heights data and add a column that indicates what season its from
initial_heights <- initial_size |> 
  filter(LifeStage == 'Seedling', Treatment != 'NR') |> 
  select(Tag, Treatment, Height, Block) |>  
  mutate(Season = 'Initial') |>
  mutate(Lifestage = 'Seedling')

# Filter the spring24 seedling heights data
spring_heights <- spring24 |> 
  filter(LifeStage == 'Seedling') |> 
  select(Tag, Treatment, Height, Block) |> 
  mutate(Season = 'Spring') |>
  mutate(Lifestage = 'Seedling')


# Filter the summer24 seedling heights data
summer_heights <- summer24 |> 
  filter(LifeStage == 'Seedling') |> 
  select(Tag, Treatment, Height, Block) |> 
  mutate(Season = 'Summer') |>
  mutate(Lifestage = 'Seedling')



# Combine the  datasets
seedling_height_data <- bind_rows(initial_heights, spring_heights, summer_heights)

# View the combined data
#print(seedling_height_data)
  

```

### Height

Create a graph that compares the overall heights

```{r}
#take out NR treatment 
seedling_height_data <- seedling_height_data |> 
  filter(Treatment != 'NR') 
  

seedling_height_data |>

  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Season , y = Height, fill = Season) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())

```

#### Create a graph that compares the change in heights by treatment

```{r}
seedling_height_data |>

  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Treatment , y = Height, fill = Season) +
  labs(x = "Treatment", y = "Height", fill = "Season") +  # Add labels
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())


```

#### Create a graph that compares the change in heights by block

```{r}
seedling_height_data |>

  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Block , y = Height, fill = Season) +
  labs(x = "Block", y = "Height", fill = "Season") +  # Add labels
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())
```

## Growth Rate

calculate and compare the growth rates between the seasons

```{r}
# Pivot wider to have heights for each season in separate columns
seedling_height_wide <- seedling_height_data |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = Season, values_from = Height)

# Calculate growth rates
seedling_height_wide <- seedling_height_wide |>
  mutate(
    Growth_Initial_to_Spring = (Spring - Initial) / Initial,
    Growth_Spring_to_Summer = (Summer - Spring) / Spring
  )

# Pivot longer to prepare for visualization
growth_rate_data <- seedling_height_wide |>
  select(Tag, Treatment, Block, Growth_Initial_to_Spring, Growth_Spring_to_Summer) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("Growth"),
    names_to = "Growth_Period",
    values_to = "Growth_Rate"
  )

# Visualization: Compare growth rates by treatment
growth_rate_data |>
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Treatment, y = Growth_Rate, fill = Growth_Period) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge()) +
  labs(
    x = "Treatment",
    y = "Growth Rate",
    fill = "Growth Period",
    title = "Comparison of Growth Rates by Treatment"
  )
```

### Summarize growth rate patterns across treatments/seasons

```{r}

growth_rate_data |>
  group_by(Treatment, Growth_Period) |>
  summarize(
    Mean_Growth = mean(Growth_Rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_Growth = sd(Growth_Rate, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

#plot it 
ggplot(growth_rate_data, 
       aes(x = Treatment, 
           y = Growth_Rate, 
           fill = Growth_Period)) +
  
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Treatment", 
       y = "Growth Rate", 
       fill = "Growth Period")


```

### Statistical test

Determine if growth rates differ significantly between treatments

```{r}
#remove any NAs
growth_rate_data <- growth_rate_data |>
  filter(!is.na(Growth_Rate) & is.finite(Growth_Rate))

#ANOVA for treatments
anova_result <- aov(Growth_Rate ~ Treatment, data = growth_rate_data)
summary(anova_result)

#as of 11/21 The treatments did not significantly affect growth rates.

```

### **Temporal Analysis**

Analyze how growth rates evolve over time and compare trajectories between treatments.

```{r}
ggplot(seedling_height_data, 
       aes(x = Season, 
           y = Height, 
           color = Treatment, 
           group = Tag)) +
  
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Season", 
       y = "Height", 
       color = "Treatment", 
       title = "Growth Rate change over time by Block") +
 
   facet_wrap(~ Block)  # Create a separate plot for each Block

```

### what about temperature? does it have an effect on growth rate

```{r}
#load in temp data 
HOBOData24 <- readRDS("HOBOData24.rds")

# Remove rows with NA in Growth_Rate or Avg_Temperature
final_data_clean <- final_data |>
  filter(!is.na(Growth_Rate) & !is.na(Avg_Temperature))

# Convert Block and Treatment to character 
growth_rate_data$Block <- as.character(growth_rate_data$Block)
HOBOData24$Block <- as.character(HOBOData24$Block)
growth_rate_data$Treatment <- as.character(growth_rate_data$Treatment)
HOBOData24$Treatment <- as.character(HOBOData24$Treatment)


# Merging the growth data with temperature data
merged_data <- merge(growth_rate_data, HOBOData24, by = c("Block", "Treatment"))

# Calculate average temperature by Block and Treatment
agg_temp_data <- HOBOData24 |>
  group_by(Block, Treatment) |>
  summarise(Avg_Temperature = mean(Temp, na.rm = TRUE))

# Merging the temperature data with the growth rate data
final_data <- merge(growth_rate_data, agg_temp_data, by = c("Block", "Treatment"))

# Linear model to test the effect of temperature on growth rate
growth_rate_temp_model <- lm(Growth_Rate ~ Avg_Temperature, data = final_data)

# Summary of the model
summary(growth_rate_temp_model)

# Model diagnostics
plot(growth_rate_temp_model)


#Temperature is a significant predictor of growth rate yay!


#visualize it 

ggplot(final_data, aes(x = Avg_Temperature, y = Growth_Rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Block, shape = Treatment), position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0), alpha = 0.7) +  # Jittering and adding Treatment shape
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +  # Add linear regression line
  labs(x = "Average Temperature", y = "Growth Rate", title = "Growth Rate vs Average Temperature") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Block") +  # Legend for Block
  scale_shape_manual(values = c(15, 17, 18, 19))  # Manually specify shapes for Treatment (can adjust the values for different shapes)



#------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Graveyard

# Including treatment as additional predictor
#growth_rate_temp_model2 <- lm(Growth_Rate ~ Avg_Temperature + Treatment, data = final_data)

# Summary of the updated model
#summary(growth_rate_temp_model2)

```

Now lets see if soil moisture has an effect on growth rate

```{r}
# Ensure 'Treatment' and 'Block' are factors for soil moisture dataset
springSM$Treatment <- as.factor(springSM$Treatment)
springSM$Block <- as.factor(springSM$Block)

# Calculate the mean soil moisture (MeanVWC) as before
springSM <- springSM |>
  mutate(across(c(VWC1, VWC2, VWC3), ~ ifelse(is.na(.), mean(., na.rm = TRUE), .))) |>
  mutate(MeanVWC = (VWC1 + VWC2 + VWC3) / 3)

# Ensure growth data also has 'Treatment' and 'Block' to enable merging
growth_rate_data$Treatment <- as.factor(growth_rate_data$Treatment)
growth_rate_data$Block <- as.factor(growth_rate_data$Block)

# Merge soil moisture and growth datasets by 'Treatment' and 'Block'
combined_data <- merge(springSM, growth_rate_data, by = c("Treatment", "Block"))

# Quick look at combined dataset
head(combined_data)

# Scatter plot of MeanVWC vs Growth Rate (Height or Leaves growth)
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = MeanVWC, y = Growth_Rate)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Treatment), size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "black") +
  labs(
    x = "Mean Spring 2024 Volumetric Water Content",
    y = "Growth Rate (Change in Height or Leaves)",
    title = "Effect of Soil Moisture on Growth Rate"
  ) 

# Linear regression to assess the relationship
model <- lm(Growth_Rate ~ MeanVWC, data = combined_data)
summary(model)

```

long story short soil moisture does not have an effect on growth rate womp womp

## Leaf Data

### Initial Leaf Count EDA

First we want to prove statistically if there is a relationship between leaf count and height

```{r}
# Create new columns with log-transformed values for Height and Leaves - Log transformation ensures the data meets the assumptions required for valid statistical analyses
initial_size$lnHeight <- log(initial_size$Height + 1)
initial_size$lnLeaves <- log(initial_size$Leaves + 1)

# Histogram of the log-transformed Height - shows us if there is a normal distribution 
library(lattice)
histogram(initial_size$lnHeight)

# Scatter plot of lnHeight vs lnLeaves
plot(initial_size$lnHeight, initial_size$lnLeaves, 
     xlab = "Ln(Initial Height)", ylab = "Ln(Number of Leaves)")

# Linear model with lnHeight as the response and lnLeaves as the predictor - tells us if there is a strong relationship between height and leaves. spoiler there very much is
height.lvs.lm <- lm(lnHeight ~ lnLeaves, data = initial_size)

# Summary of the linear model
summary(height.lvs.lm)

# Diagnostic plots for the linear model - Ensures the model is appropriate for the data.
plot(height.lvs.lm)
```

There is a relationship which is great!

### Create a data set that has the leaf counts across seasons

```{r}

# Filter the spring24 leaf count data
spring_leaves <- spring24 |> 
  filter(LifeStage == 'Seedling', Treatment != 'NR') |> 
  select(Tag, Treatment, Leaves, Block) |> 
  mutate(Season = 'Spring') |>
  mutate(Lifestage = 'Seedling')


# Filter the summer24 leaf count data
summer_leaves <- summer24 |> 
  filter(LifeStage == 'Seedling', Treatment != 'NR') |> 
  select(Tag, Treatment, Leaves, Block) |> 
  mutate(Season = 'Summer') |>
  mutate(Lifestage = 'Seedling')


# Combine the  datasets
seedling_leaf_data <- bind_rows(spring_leaves, summer_leaves)

# View the combined data
print(seedling_leaf_data)
  
```

### Visualizations

Leaf count across seasons

```{r}
seedling_leaf_data |>

  ggplot() +
  aes(x = Season , y = Leaves, fill = Season) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())

ggplot(seedling_leaf_data, aes(x = Season, y = Leaves, group = Tag, color = Tag)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Season", y = "Leaf Count", title = "Change in Leaf Count Across Seasons") +

  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Block) +  # Or replace with Block or another grouping variable
  labs(x = "Season", y = "Leaf Count", title = "Change in Leaf Count Across Seasons by Treatment") +
  theme_minimal()


```

## Soil Moisture

```{r}

#spring 2024 soil moisture 

#If Treatment was previously a character or numeric type, this line changes it to a factor, which can be important for plotting or running statistical models that require categorical variables.

springSM$Treatment <- as.factor(springSM$Treatment)
springSM$Block <- as.factor(springSM$Block)


#plot the data:
plot(springSM$Treatment, springSM$VWC1, 
     xlab = "Planting Location", 
     ylab="Spring 2024 Volumetric Water Content")



#let's make a new variable, the average of VWC

# Replace NAs with the mean of each VWC column
springSM <- springSM |>
  mutate(across(c(VWC1, VWC2, VWC3), ~ ifelse(is.na(.), mean(., na.rm = TRUE), .)))

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Calculate MeanVWC
MeanVWC <- springSM |>
  mutate(MeanVWC = (VWC1 + VWC2 + VWC3) / 3) |>

# Create the bar plot showing mean vwc in each treatment 
ggplot(data = MeanVWC, aes(x = Treatment, y = MeanVWC)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +  # Ensure you include stat = "identity"
  labs(x = "Planting Location", y = "Mean Spring 2024 Volumetric Water Content")   # Add labels
  
# Create box and whisker graph showing mean vwc in each treatment 
plot(springSM$Treatment, springSM$MeanVWC, 
     xlab = "Planting Location", 
     ylab="Spring 2024 Volumetric Water Content")

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#lets do the same for the blocks 

# Create the bar plot showing mean vwc in each block 
ggplot(data = MeanVWC, aes(x = Block, y = MeanVWC)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) +  # Ensure you include stat = "identity"
  labs(x = "Planting Location", y = "Mean Spring 2024 Volumetric Water Content")   # Add labels
  

#plot(springSM$Block, springSM$MeanVWC, 
     #xlab="Experimental Block", 
     #ylab="Spring 2024 Volumetric Water Content")



```

## Germination

total germinated seeds in each season

```{r}
# Combine germination data for all seasons
germination_data <- bind_rows(
  spring24 |> select(Block, Treatment, GerminatedAcorns) |> mutate(Season = "Spring"),
  summer24 |> select(Block, Treatment, GerminatedAcorns) |> mutate(Season = "Summer")
)

# Summarize total germinated seeds per season
germination_summary <- germination_data |>
  group_by(Season) |>
  summarise(Total_Germinated = sum(GerminatedAcorns, na.rm = TRUE))

print(germination_summary)

germination_summary |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Season, y = Total_Germinated, fill = Season)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Total Germinated Seeds by Season", x = "Season", y = "Total Germinated")

```

Germinated seeds by block and treatment

```{r}
germination_by_block_treatment <- germination_data |>
  group_by(Block, Treatment, Season) |>
  summarise(Total_Germinated = sum(GerminatedAcorns, na.rm = TRUE))

print(germination_by_block_treatment)

```

Germination rate

```{r}
# Add Total_Seeds_Planted column 
germination_data <- germination_data |> mutate(Total_Seeds_Planted = 128)  

# Calculate germination rates
germination_data <- germination_data |>

```

Statistical Analysis

#### Effect of Treatment, Block, and Temperature on Germination Rate

```{r}

# Load temperature data
HOBOData24 <- readRDS("HOBOData24.rds")

# Merge germination data with temperature data
germination_temp_data <- merge(germination_data, final_data, by = c("Block", "Treatment"))

average blocks separate by treatment - effect on treatment

Soil Moisture effect on germination rate

```{r}
germ_moist_data <- merge(springSM, germination_data, by = c("Treatment", "Block"))
